I am an applied research scientist at Amazon, Hyderabad, India. Prior to that, I was a post-doc at Facebook Reality Labs in Redmond, WA, USA. I completed my PhD at INRIA-Sophia Antipolis in France. I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Pierre Kornprobst](https://team.inria.fr/biovision/pierre-kornprobst/) and [Dr. Guillaume Masson](http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/MASSON-Guillaume). I did my bachelors and masters in Electronics and Communications at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India.
