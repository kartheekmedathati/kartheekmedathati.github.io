I am a self employed Research Scientist. My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, neuroscience and machine learning. My career objective is to leverage the symbiotic relationship between platforms, AI research, and neuroscience, creating innovative solutions that not only advance our understanding of the brain and artificial intelligence but also empower platforms to facilitate transformative applications in these fields. By bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical implementation, I aspire to contribute to the development of technology that enhances both human knowledge and technological capabilities.

Coming to work experience, I was an Applied Research Scientist with Amazon Prime Video in Seattle, WA, USA. I have also worked as a PostDoc with Facebook Reality Labs, Redmond, USA. I completed my PhD at INRIA-Sophia Antipolis in France. I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Pierre Kornprobst](https://team.inria.fr/biovision/pierre-kornprobst/) and [Dr. Guillaume Masson](http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/MASSON-Guillaume). I did my bachelors and masters in Electronics and Communications at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India.
