I am a self employed Research Scientist. My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, neuroscience and machine learning. I believe that recent advances in neurosciences can give us novel insights into developing robust vision/AI systems.

Coming to work experience, I was an Applied Research Scientist with Amazon Prime Video in Seattle, WA, USA. I have also worked as a PostDoc with Facebook Reality Labs, Redmond, USA. I completed my PhD at INRIA-Sophia Antipolis in France. I was jointly supervised by [Dr. Pierre Kornprobst](https://team.inria.fr/biovision/pierre-kornprobst/) and [Dr. Guillaume Masson](http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/MASSON-Guillaume). I did my bachelors and masters in Electronics and Communications at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India.
