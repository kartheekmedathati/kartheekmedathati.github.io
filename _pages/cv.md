Education
======
* B. Tech. in ECE, IIIT-Hyderabad, 2009
* M.S. in ECE, IIIT-Hyderabad, 2011
* Ph.D in Automatic Signal and Image Processing, INRIA/UCA, 2016

Work experience
======

* Oct 2017 - Oct 2019: Postdotoral Research Scientist
  * Facebook Reality Labs (Oculus Research), Redmond, WA, USA  
  * My duties included identification of several uses of eye tracking, biosensing technologies along with visual semantic information to enable naturalistic human-computer interactions. I have designed and implemented two user studies involving eye tracking, pupillometry, world facing camera and EEG for identifying user’s cognitive state changes in indoor environments under naturalistic settings. Applied machine learning techniques for event detection from multi-modal time-series data. My work is very well received and has resulted in an internal demo and two posters.
  * Supervisor: James Hillis

* Feb 2013 - July 2013: Research Assistant
  * NeuroMathComp project team, Inria-Sophia Antipolis
  * My duties included development of computational models of multi-stable motion perception in case of barber poles. I have developed numerical continuation routines using CUDA for simulating a 3-dimensional recurrent neural field model. The model allowed us to find oscillatory solutions capturing spatial motion integration in case of moving gratings observed under square and rectangular apertures.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Pierre Kornprobst

* Jun 2012 - Dec 2012: Research Assistant
  * School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore
  * My duties included prototyping a light field acquision system using a camera array. I have developed routines for acquisition, calibration and rendering of light fields using a camera array of 5x5 GigE cameras. This allowed us to understand the sampling challenges that need to be addressed for bringing camera arrays to mobile devices.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Micheal Brown

* Aug 2011 - Mar 2012: Consultant
  * G. E. Global Research, Bangalore, India
  * Designed and developed a solution for automatic, reliable, and high-speed pose correction of 3D CT head scans based on crucial anatomic landmarks.

* May 2009 - Aug 2009: Research Assistant
  * Center for Visual Information Technology, IIIT-Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India
  * Developed programs for automatic image quality estimation and restoration of retinal color fundus images.

* May 2008 – Jul 2008: Intern
  * G. E. Global Research, Bangalore, India
  * Designed and developed a program for automatic anatomic labeling and interactive visualization of neural vasculature in 3D CT head scans. Received special appreciation from the manager for delivering a solution in short span of two and half months.
