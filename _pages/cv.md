Work experience

* Oct 2017 - Oct 2019: Postdotoral Research Scientist 
  * My work involved identification of several uses of eye tracking, biosensing technologies along with visual semantic information to enable naturalistic human-computer interactions. Towards this, I have designed and implemented two user studies (eye tracking, pupillometry, world facing camera, EEG) for studying userâ€™s cognitive state changes in indoor environments under naturalistic settings. Applied machine learning techniques for event detection from time-series data. My work has resulted in one internal demo and two poster presentations.
