excerpt: 'Decoding the motion energies is of natural interest for developing biologically inspired computer vision algorithms for dense optical flow estimation. Here, we address this problem by evaluating four strategies for motion decoding: intersection of constraints, linear decoding through learned weights on MT responses, maximum likelihood and regression with neural network using multi scale-features.
